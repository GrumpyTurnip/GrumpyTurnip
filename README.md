**GrumpyTurnip/GrumpyTurnip** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on pushing code and depositing repositorys !
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning all things data science, discovering patterns with Maching learning and Natural Language Processing.
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...The heaviest turnip weighed 17.7 kg (39 lb 3 oz) and was grown by Scott and Mardie Robb (both USA) and in Roman times, the turnip was the weapon of choice to hurl at unpopular public figures !
